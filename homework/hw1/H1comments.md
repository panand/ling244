##Overall

Alan, this is excellent. Thanks for doing the dictionary creation; that seemed to take a lot of work. I appreciate the effort. I have some small comments in the general body, but they are tiny. Excellent work.

##Correctness

Everything is fine, though you changed my key...

##Readability

Your code was very readable; your names for variables were clear and the overall design was well laid out.

##Documentation

Your comments were well done throughout.

##Efficiency

The code is elegant and well designed. There was one efficiency issue, but it is a subtle one.
